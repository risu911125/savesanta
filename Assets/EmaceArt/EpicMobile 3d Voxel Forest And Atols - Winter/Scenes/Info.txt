Drag and drop two scenes into the hierarchy:
EpicWoodland_Winter and Epic and Woodland_PostProcess

Install the Post-Processing Stack (or HDRP, URP)

1. Open Unity (or Unity Hub)
2. Create a project (or use existing one if you want)
3. At the top, select Window > Package Manager
4. Wait a minute as it takes some time for all the packages to load. Unity is transitioning their assets here as well so get used to this interface
5. Scroll down the list on the left to Post Processing
6. Click Install in bottom right
7. Depending on your device, this will also take about a minute to import the Shaders and such
